Public disgust with Washington gridlock remains high, and with the 2016 presidential campaign beginning in earnest, broader voter interest \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 especially among independents and Democrats \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 could put recent GOP gains at risk in less than two years.\\n\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cOn the things where we agree, the goal will be to make a law, not just put something on [Obama\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s] desk,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in an interview, adding later: \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI want to make it clear: Desire for a signature is not going to dictate everything that we do.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d\\n\\nSecuring final passage of bills will require McConnell and House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) to compromise with Democrats while holding together their own ranks, which have clashed repeatedly over issues such as spending and immigration. Many GOP leaders hope that their differences can be set aside in favor of legislative wins.\\n\\nThe House and Senate formally reconvene Tuesday. New members will be sworn in and top leaders and committee chairmen formally installed on a day steeped in tradition and ceremony.\\n\\nBoehner and McConnell will be backed by larger GOP majorities: 246 Republicans in the House \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 the party\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s largest majority since just after World War II \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 and 54 GOP senators, an impressive gain but short of the 60 votes required to overcome most procedural hurdles that Democrats will have at their disposal.\\n\\nIn the Senate, the rebranding effort will begin with energy policy.\\n\\nMcConnell plans to start his tenure as Senate majority leader with a \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cfull-throated\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d debate on national energy policy, ranging from a new oil pipeline to additional oil exploration. He has also promised consideration of liberal alternatives.\\n\\nMcConnell wants to use the controversial proposal to authorize construction of the Keystone XL pipeline as the gen\\u00c2\\u00adesis for a free-wheeling Senate debate about the United States\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 energy future, in which both sides will have the opportunity to offer and debate more expansive energy issues than the narrow pipeline proposal.\\n\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cWe can treat this like a serious and significant energy debate,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d McConnell said in an interview before Christmas in his Capitol office.\\n\\nObama has resisted GOP efforts to authorize the pipeline, but dozens of moderate congressional Democrats support the bill and a broader energy debate.\\n\\nOther Democrats are skeptical of McConnell\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s plans.\\n\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cThe $64,000 question as to whether the Congress can get anything done is which way the Republican leadership goes,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in an interview Saturday. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cIf they let the tea party pull them to the right into the path of negativity and obstruction, we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll get nothing done.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d\\n\\nSen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.), a lead author of the Keystone bill, said that Republicans plan to consider proposals allowing the export of liquefied natural gas; to give state governments greater power to oversee hydraulic fracturing; and to restrict the federal government\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s role in the construction of cross-border gas pipelines.\\n\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI don\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t think we have an energy bill that doesn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t have a Democratic co-sponsor on it,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d he said. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cBecause at the end of the day you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve got to get at least 60 votes\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d to clear procedural hurdles.\\n\\nThe open process is part of McConnell\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s effort to live up to his pledge to restore the Senate\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s grand tradition of free and full debate, while also advancing conservative causes. A skilled practitioner in the use of the Senate\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s arcane procedural rules to move or block legislation, McConnell has pledged to use those rules to score conservative wins. He has been coaching GOP senators that their most likely path to wins will come on the annual spending bills for the federal government \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 which Republicans have routinely opposed on the grounds that they spend too much taxpayer money.\\n\\nOther party leaders echo those sentiments. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI think a majority [of Republicans] recognize that we have to govern responsibly,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who will become chairman of the Armed Services Committee. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cWe have to show that we can be a productive party, and that, I think, will have a direct effect on whether we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re able to elect a Republican as president in 2016.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d\\n\\nBut now, with control of the House and Senate, Republicans have more leeway to attach policy riders to spending bills that will restrict federal agencies in their oversight of environmental, labor and other regulations. These still may draw presidential vetoes, but McConnell believes that Republicans will have leverage to get some restrictions included, just as the mammoth spending measure approved last month included language sought by Wall Street firms making risky trades.\\n\\nIn the House, most of the early weeks will seem like a do-over of the past two years \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 except that many of the bills passed will get swifter Senate consideration.\\n\\nUp first is a veterans employment bill that passed last year with bipartisan support, according to senior leadership aides. There is also a bill to loosen work requirements set by the Affordable Care Act and a similar bill to authorize the Keystone pipeline.\\n\\nThe second week of January will be devoted to a new spending plan for the Department of Homeland Security. The spending bill funds DHS only until the end of February, a move designed to give Republicans more time to craft a legislative response to Obama\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s decision to change immigration policy through executive actions. But no specific proposals have emerged, the aides said.\\n\\nThen there are the investigations into alleged wrongdoing at agencies including the Internal Revenue Service, the Justice Department and the Environmental Protection Agency.\\n\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cThere are issues that haven\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t been resolved,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d said Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), the new chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\\n\\nHe is launching subcommittees to closely track Obama\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s energy and environmental policies and created \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cadministrative rules,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d a panel that will \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009ctry to figure out what the administration is doing next with its rule-making authority. We\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re going to jump on those as fast as we possibly can,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d he said.\\n\\nBefore the work begins, Boehner is expected to face another leadership challenge. After he survived a close call two years ago, conservative blogs and radio shows are actively supporting another effort to unseat him.\\n\\nPresuming that the 434 currently seated House members show up to vote Tuesday and that all Democrats vote against him, at least 28 of the 246 Republicans also would need to vote against Boehner to deny him the gavel. (The 435th House seat is held by Rep. Michael G. Grimm (R-N.Y.), who plans to resign Monday after recently pleading guilty to tax evasion charges.)\\n\\nRep. Walter B. Jones (R-N.C.), who opposed Boehner two years ago, said in a recent radio interview that he\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll do it again, adding that at least 16 to 18 Republican members might vote against the speaker. Among them is Rep. Jim Bridenstine (R-Okla.), who said Friday that he will vote against the speaker because the spending bill passed last month didn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t fully strip DHS of its funding.\\n\\nRep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a Boehner ally, said in an interview that \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI expect a few scattered \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0098no\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 votes. But because Boehner has been strengthened by the gains in the election, the speaker election should mostly be an uneventful coronation.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d\\n\\nThe opening weeks of the new Congress are also expected to include the confirmation of Ashton Carter, Obama\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s pick to lead the Pentagon, and Loretta Lynch to be the next attorney general. Concerns with Iran are also expected to be an early focus. The Obama administration persuaded Senate Democrats last year to hold off debating a bipartisan proposal authorizing stronger sanctions against the Iranian regime.\\n\\nBut Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), the incoming chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cMy guess is fairly early on in some form or fashion the Senate\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s going to want to weigh in on Iran.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d\\n\\nCorker also plans to launch \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009ca rigorous hearing process\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d on Obama\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s decision to restore diplomatic relations with Cuba. Republicans have threatened to block funding for a new embassy in Havana and confirmation of a new ambassador to Cuba. But Obama could veto spending bills that include such restrictions, sparking a showdown over whether the GOP is willing to shutter parts of the government over a new Cuba policy.\\n\\nIn 2016, Republicans will be defending at least 24 Senate seats and about a dozen first-term House members from swing districts around the country. Party leaders have a political imperative to govern and avoid short-term fights with Obama.\\n\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cWe will see if there is an opportunity for a fourth quarter for President Obama that actually moves the country in the direction we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d like to go,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d said Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), who also will be responsible for helping reelect GOP senators in 2016.\\n\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cReagan did it a generation ago working with Democrats. Clinton did it almost two decades ago with welfare reform and deficit reduction,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d he said. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cSo it can be done \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 if the president is disposed to move in that direction.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d\",\n          \"Reps. Kevin McCarthy, R-California, Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and Daniel Webster, R-Florida, are the three candidates vying for the post, and the winner becomes the favorite to become second in line to succeed the President of the United States.\\n\\nBut Thursday's vote inside the House GOP conference is just the first step. The candidate who gets the Republican party's internal nod still has to be approved by the full House of Representatives on October 29. And that's where things can get tricky.\\n\\nIf the Republican nominee can't garner 218 votes on the House floor, then Boehner will remain the speaker. And the potential for multiple rounds of votes on the House floor could open up the election to other candidates beyond the three that are in the race now. It would also prolong the deeply divisive and public process for House Republicans, who are hoping to chart a new path forward and prove they can make the dysfunctional Capitol work.\\n\\nThe three candidates will make their pitch to GOP colleagues at a \\\"candidate forum\\\" on Thursday morning in a conference room in the basement of the Capitol. Each gets three minutes to make a speech before answering questions from members. At noon, the 247 members of the House Republican conference gather in the ornate Ways and Means Committee room to vote. Under the House GOP conference rules, the three candidates are not allowed to make their own speeches. Instead each can designate one supporter to make a three-minute address nominating them for the post. Then up to two additional supporters can speak for another minute each on the candidate's behalf. To win the GOP nomination, a candidate needs a simple majority of all House Republicans -- or 125 votes. (That number could change if any House Republicans are absent or opts not to vote in the election.) Boehner plans to vote for McCarthy before heading to New York to tape an appearance on \\\"The Tonight Show,\\\" according to a spokesman. The delegate from American Samoa, Amata Radewagen, who doesn't get a vote on the House floor, does get to cast a vote for speaker inside the conference meeting. RELATED: John Boehner to appear on 'The Tonight Show' Three members serve as \\\"tally clerks\\\" and collect the ballots and count how many votes each candidate receives. Once all the ballots are counted, a representative of the conference will announce the results, along with the vote totals. If no candidate gets a majority of the conference on the first vote, a second ballot circulates with the names of the top two vote-getters, and a winner is announced after those ballots are counted. The new speaker can't take the gavel from Boehner until the full House of Representatives votes. Unlike the private contest on Thursday, the floor vote is covered live by C-SPAN's television cameras inside the House chamber. Each member of Congress is called on in alphabetical order to stand and announce their choice for speaker. The winner must win the votes of a majority -- 218, if everyone in the House is present -- in order to win. The vast majority of House Democrats are expected for to vote for former Speaker and current Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. House Republican conference rules require that GOP members support their party's nominee on the floor, but many conservatives have ignored that rule in recent elections. That's where any drama will occur. If the GOP nominee fails to get a majority, the contest on the House floor could go to multiple ballots. Boehner will remain the speaker until a majority of the House votes to elect a new candidate. The last time it took more than one ballot to elect a speaker was in 1923 when it took nine ballots over the course of three days. And you don't need to be in the House to get the job. The Constitution does not require that the speaker be someone currently serving in Congress, but all who have been elected to the post have been House members. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell, Sen. Rand Paul and Sen. Jeff Sessions received votes in the January 2015 election . And two years earlier, David Walker, the former head of the General Accounting Office, received one vote\",\n          \"Over the last six years, the Obama administration has been trying to address global warming\\u00c2\\u00a0with a flurry of rules aimed at reducing US carbon-dioxide emissions. First there were stricter fuel-economy standards for cars and trucks. More recently, the EPA\\u00c2\\u00a0proposed sweeping carbon regulations for coal-fired power plants (known as the \\\"Clean Power Plan\\\").\\n\\nThe overarching goal was to cut US greenhouse-gas emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. That, the administration believed, would help advance global climate talks.\\n\\nBut all of Obama's moves so far\\u00c2\\u00a0have been insufficient to get to that 17 percent cut by 2020. As recent analyses from the Rhodium Group and the Clean Air Task Force\\u00c2\\u00a0have argued, the US also needs to reduce methane emissions dramatically to get there:\\n\\nCarbon-dioxide is the biggest greenhouse gas responsible for global warming. But it's not the only one. There's also\\u00c2\\u00a0methane.\\u00c2\\u00a0The US burns a lot of methane \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 known as \\\"natural gas\\\" \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 for energy. But when methane leaks out of oil and gas wells or pipelines and into the atmosphere, it acts as a potent greenhouse gas. (The White House says it's 25 times as effective at trapping heat as carbon dioxide. Other scientists say 34 times.)\\n\\nIn 2012, the EPA estimated that methane accounted for roughly\\u00c2\\u00a08.7 percent of US greenhouse-gas emissions (though this may be an\\u00c2\\u00a0underestimate). But experts have warned that methane leaks could be poised to grow in the coming years.\\n\\nThanks to the\\u00c2\\u00a0fracking boom, US energy companies have been extracting more and more natural gas from shale formations. On one level, that's good news for climate change: utilities are now burning more natural gas for electricity instead of coal, which means lower carbon-dioxide emissions from power plants.\\n\\nThe problem is that all this new drilling increases the risk of methane leaking into the air \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 and those leaks\\u00c2\\u00a0are undermining the climate benefits of the gas boom.\\n\\nIn theory, it should be doable to plug these methane emissions,\\u00c2\\u00a0which can come from leaky pipelines or faulty drilling operations. Many companies already\\u00c2\\u00a0use infrared cameras to detect leaks and plug them. And they have financial incentives to do so \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 after all, these companies would rather capture that methane and sell it for money than just have it float off into the air.\\n\\nMany oil and gas companies are already taking steps to detect and plug leaks\\n\\nStill, the White House wants to make sure these leaks really get plugged. So, on Wednesday, it\\u00c2\\u00a0announced a goal of cutting methane emissions from oil and gas operations 45 percent below 2012 levels by 2025.\\n\\nThis would be done through a combination of guidelines for voluntary actions by the industry and a hodgepodge of new regulations\\u00c2\\u00a0crafted by the EPA and other agencies. Some rules would focus on methane leaks from new oil and gas wells. Others would focus on pipelines used to transport the natural gas. The Interior Department is updating standards for drilling on public lands.\\n\\nThe White House noted that the oil and gas industry has already managed to cut methane emissions 16 percent since 1990 through voluntary measures. \\\"Nevertheless,\\\" it added, \\\"emissions from the oil and gas sector are projected to rise more than 25 percent by 2025 without additional steps to lower them.\\\"\\n\\nSome environmental groups said the White House's plan didn't go far enough. For example, the EPA is currently only working on rules to reduce emissions at new oil and gas wells \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 and only much later will they work on rules for\\u00c2\\u00a0existing wells, which are by far the biggest source of emissions.\\n\\n\\\"While setting methane standards for the first time is an important step, failing to immediately regulate existing oil and gas equipment nationwide misses 90% of the methane pollution from the industry,\\\" Conrad Schneider of the Clean Air Task Force said in a statement.\\n\\nJayni Hein, policy director at the Institute for Policy Integrity at NYU School of Law, agreed: \\\"EPA's steps announced today would trim the sector's methane releases by about a third. We can and should go farther by regulating existing oil and natural gas sources.\\\"\\n\\nBy contrast, many oil and gas companies don't want new regulations at all \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 they argue that the industry is already curbing methane leaks as is.\\u00c2\\u00a0\\\"Emissions will continue to fall as operators innovate and find new ways to capture and deliver more methane to consumers,\\\" said Jack Gerard, head of the American Petroleum Institute, in a statement. \\\"Existing EPA and state regulations are working. Another layer of burdensome requirements could actually slow down industry progress to reduce methane emissions.\\\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, it's worth noting that there are other sources of methane besides oil and gas. In 2012,\\u00c2\\u00a0according to the EPA, roughly 30 percent of methane in the United States came from natural-gas and petroleum operations (though, again, that may be an undercount).\\n\\nObama is relying on voluntary measures for methane in agriculture\\n\\n-- By contrast,\\u00c2\\u00a036 percent of US.methane emissions came from agriculture. The beef and dairy industry is a major contributor here: when cows belch, they produce methane (known as \\\"enteric fermentation\\\"). Other sources include decomposing cow manure, as well as methane from rice cultivation.\\n\\n-- Another\\u00c2\\u00a018 percent came from landfills. When food and other trash decays in a landfill, the organisms that feed on that trash emit methane into the atmosphere.\\n\\nThe Obama administration\\u00c2\\u00a0has been working on steps to cut methane in these areas, too. Back in March, the EPA announced it would come up with standards to reduce methane from all future landfills. It will then solicit public comments on whether to regulate landfills that have already been built.\\n\\nAs for cow burps, however, the administration is relying on purely voluntary measures for now. In June 2014, the EPA unveiled a \\\"partnership\\\" with the dairy industry to speed up the adoption of methane digesters that turn cow dung into energy. The hope is to reduce methane emissions from the dairy sector 25 percent by 2020.\\n\\nFurther reading: Obama has promised to cut US emissions 17% by 2020.

Public disgust with Washington gridlock remains high, and with the 2016 presidential campaign beginning in earnest, broader voter interest \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 especially among independents and Democrats \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 could put recent GOP gains at risk in less than two years.\\n\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cOn the things where we agree, the goal will be to make a law, not just put something on [Obama\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s] desk,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in an interview, adding later: \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI want to make it clear: Desire for a signature is not going to dictate everything that we do.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d\\n\\nSecuring final passage of bills will require McConnell and House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) to compromise with Democrats while holding together their own ranks, which have clashed repeatedly over issues such as spending and immigration. Many GOP leaders hope that their differences can be set aside in favor of legislative wins.\\n\\nThe House and Senate formally reconvene Tuesday. New members will be sworn in and top leaders and committee chairmen formally installed on a day steeped in tradition and ceremony.\\n\\nBoehner and McConnell will be backed by larger GOP majorities: 246 Republicans in the House \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 the party\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s largest majority since just after World War II \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 and 54 GOP senators, an impressive gain but short of the 60 votes required to overcome most procedural hurdles that Democrats will have at their disposal.\\n\\nIn the Senate, the rebranding effort will begin with energy policy.\\n\\nMcConnell plans to start his tenure as Senate majority leader with a \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cfull-throated\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d debate on national energy policy, ranging from a new oil pipeline to additional oil exploration. He has also promised consideration of liberal alternatives.\\n\\nMcConnell wants to use the controversial proposal to authorize construction of the Keystone XL pipeline as the gen\\u00c2\\u00adesis for a free-wheeling Senate debate about the United States\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 energy future, in which both sides will have the opportunity to offer and debate more expansive energy issues than the narrow pipeline proposal.\\n\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cWe can treat this like a serious and significant energy debate,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d McConnell said in an interview before Christmas in his Capitol office.\\n\\nObama has resisted GOP efforts to authorize the pipeline, but dozens of moderate congressional Democrats support the bill and a broader energy debate.\\n\\nOther Democrats are skeptical of McConnell\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s plans.\\n\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cThe $64,000 question as to whether the Congress can get anything done is which way the Republican leadership goes,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in an interview Saturday. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cIf they let the tea party pull them to the right into the path of negativity and obstruction, we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll get nothing done.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d\\n\\nSen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.), a lead author of the Keystone bill, said that Republicans plan to consider proposals allowing the export of liquefied natural gas; to give state governments greater power to oversee hydraulic fracturing; and to restrict the federal government\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s role in the construction of cross-border gas pipelines.\\n\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI don\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t think we have an energy bill that doesn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t have a Democratic co-sponsor on it,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d he said. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cBecause at the end of the day you\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve got to get at least 60 votes\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d to clear procedural hurdles.\\n\\nThe open process is part of McConnell\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s effort to live up to his pledge to restore the Senate\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s grand tradition of free and full debate, while also advancing conservative causes. A skilled practitioner in the use of the Senate\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s arcane procedural rules to move or block legislation, McConnell has pledged to use those rules to score conservative wins. He has been coaching GOP senators that their most likely path to wins will come on the annual spending bills for the federal government \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 which Republicans have routinely opposed on the grounds that they spend too much taxpayer money.\\n\\nOther party leaders echo those sentiments. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI think a majority [of Republicans] recognize that we have to govern responsibly,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who will become chairman of the Armed Services Committee. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cWe have to show that we can be a productive party, and that, I think, will have a direct effect on whether we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re able to elect a Republican as president in 2016.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d\\n\\nBut now, with control of the House and Senate, Republicans have more leeway to attach policy riders to spending bills that will restrict federal agencies in their oversight of environmental, labor and other regulations. These still may draw presidential vetoes, but McConnell believes that Republicans will have leverage to get some restrictions included, just as the mammoth spending measure approved last month included language sought by Wall Street firms making risky trades.\\n\\nIn the House, most of the early weeks will seem like a do-over of the past two years \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 except that many of the bills passed will get swifter Senate consideration.\\n\\nUp first is a veterans employment bill that passed last year with bipartisan support, according to senior leadership aides. There is also a bill to loosen work requirements set by the Affordable Care Act and a similar bill to authorize the Keystone pipeline.\\n\\nThe second week of January will be devoted to a new spending plan for the Department of Homeland Security. The spending bill funds DHS only until the end of February, a move designed to give Republicans more time to craft a legislative response to Obama\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s decision to change immigration policy through executive actions. But no specific proposals have emerged, the aides said.\\n\\nThen there are the investigations into alleged wrongdoing at agencies including the Internal Revenue Service, the Justice Department and the Environmental Protection Agency.\\n\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cThere are issues that haven\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t been resolved,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d said Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), the new chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\\n\\nHe is launching subcommittees to closely track Obama\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s energy and environmental policies and created \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cadministrative rules,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d a panel that will \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009ctry to figure out what the administration is doing next with its rule-making authority. We\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re going to jump on those as fast as we possibly can,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d he said.\\n\\nBefore the work begins, Boehner is expected to face another leadership challenge. After he survived a close call two years ago, conservative blogs and radio shows are actively supporting another effort to unseat him.\\n\\nPresuming that the 434 currently seated House members show up to vote Tuesday and that all Democrats vote against him, at least 28 of the 246 Republicans also would need to vote against Boehner to deny him the gavel. (The 435th House seat is held by Rep. Michael G. Grimm (R-N.Y.), who plans to resign Monday after recently pleading guilty to tax evasion charges.)\\n\\nRep. Walter B. Jones (R-N.C.), who opposed Boehner two years ago, said in a recent radio interview that he\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ll do it again, adding that at least 16 to 18 Republican members might vote against the speaker. Among them is Rep. Jim Bridenstine (R-Okla.), who said Friday that he will vote against the speaker because the spending bill passed last month didn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t fully strip DHS of its funding.\\n\\nRep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a Boehner ally, said in an interview that \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI expect a few scattered \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0098no\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 votes. But because Boehner has been strengthened by the gains in the election, the speaker election should mostly be an uneventful coronation.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d\\n\\nThe opening weeks of the new Congress are also expected to include the confirmation of Ashton Carter, Obama\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s pick to lead the Pentagon, and Loretta Lynch to be the next attorney general. Concerns with Iran are also expected to be an early focus. The Obama administration persuaded Senate Democrats last year to hold off debating a bipartisan proposal authorizing stronger sanctions against the Iranian regime.\\n\\nBut Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), the incoming chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cMy guess is fairly early on in some form or fashion the Senate\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s going to want to weigh in on Iran.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d\\n\\nCorker also plans to launch \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009ca rigorous hearing process\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d on Obama\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s decision to restore diplomatic relations with Cuba. Republicans have threatened to block funding for a new embassy in Havana and confirmation of a new ambassador to Cuba. But Obama could veto spending bills that include such restrictions, sparking a showdown over whether the GOP is willing to shutter parts of the government over a new Cuba policy.\\n\\nIn 2016, Republicans will be defending at least 24 Senate seats and about a dozen first-term House members from swing districts around the country. Party leaders have a political imperative to govern and avoid short-term fights with Obama.\\n\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cWe will see if there is an opportunity for a fourth quarter for President Obama that actually moves the country in the direction we\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099d like to go,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d said Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), who also will be responsible for helping reelect GOP senators in 2016.\\n\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cReagan did it a generation ago working with Democrats. Clinton did it almost two decades ago with welfare reform and deficit reduction,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d he said. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cSo it can be done \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 if the president is disposed to move in that direction.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d\",\n          \"Reps. Kevin McCarthy, R-California, Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and Daniel Webster, R-Florida, are the three candidates vying for the post, and the winner becomes the favorite to become second in line to succeed the President of the United States.\\n\\nBut Thursday's vote inside the House GOP conference is just the first step. The candidate who gets the Republican party's internal nod still has to be approved by the full House of Representatives on October 29. And that's where things can get tricky.\\n\\nIf the Republican nominee can't garner 218 votes on the House floor, then Boehner will remain the speaker. And the potential for multiple rounds of votes on the House floor could open up the election to other candidates beyond the three that are in the race now. It would also prolong the deeply divisive and public process for House Republicans, who are hoping to chart a new path forward and prove they can make the dysfunctional Capitol work.\\n\\nThe three candidates will make their pitch to GOP colleagues at a \\\"candidate forum\\\" on Thursday morning in a conference room in the basement of the Capitol. Each gets three minutes to make a speech before answering questions from members. At noon, the 247 members of the House Republican conference gather in the ornate Ways and Means Committee room to vote. Under the House GOP conference rules, the three candidates are not allowed to make their own speeches. Instead each can designate one supporter to make a three-minute address nominating them for the post. Then up to two additional supporters can speak for another minute each on the candidate's behalf. To win the GOP nomination, a candidate needs a simple majority of all House Republicans -- or 125 votes. (That number could change if any House Republicans are absent or opts not to vote in the election.) Boehner plans to vote for McCarthy before heading to New York to tape an appearance on \\\"The Tonight Show,\\\" according to a spokesman. The delegate from American Samoa, Amata Radewagen, who doesn't get a vote on the House floor, does get to cast a vote for speaker inside the conference meeting. RELATED: John Boehner to appear on 'The Tonight Show' Three members serve as \\\"tally clerks\\\" and collect the ballots and count how many votes each candidate receives. Once all the ballots are counted, a representative of the conference will announce the results, along with the vote totals. If no candidate gets a majority of the conference on the first vote, a second ballot circulates with the names of the top two vote-getters, and a winner is announced after those ballots are counted. The new speaker can't take the gavel from Boehner until the full House of Representatives votes. Unlike the private contest on Thursday, the floor vote is covered live by C-SPAN's television cameras inside the House chamber. Each member of Congress is called on in alphabetical order to stand and announce their choice for speaker. The winner must win the votes of a majority -- 218, if everyone in the House is present -- in order to win. The vast majority of House Democrats are expected for to vote for former Speaker and current Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. House Republican conference rules require that GOP members support their party's nominee on the floor, but many conservatives have ignored that rule in recent elections. That's where any drama will occur. If the GOP nominee fails to get a majority, the contest on the House floor could go to multiple ballots. Boehner will remain the speaker until a majority of the House votes to elect a new candidate. The last time it took more than one ballot to elect a speaker was in 1923 when it took nine ballots over the course of three days. And you don't need to be in the House to get the job. The Constitution does not require that the speaker be someone currently serving in Congress, but all who have been elected to the post have been House members. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell, Sen. Rand Paul and Sen. Jeff Sessions received votes in the January 2015 election . And two years earlier, David Walker, the former head of the General Accounting Office, received one vote\",\n          \"Over the last six years, the Obama administration has been trying to address global warming\\u00c2\\u00a0with a flurry of rules aimed at reducing US carbon-dioxide emissions. First there were stricter fuel-economy standards for cars and trucks. More recently, the EPA\\u00c2\\u00a0proposed sweeping carbon regulations for coal-fired power plants (known as the \\\"Clean Power Plan\\\").\\n\\nThe overarching goal was to cut US greenhouse-gas emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. That, the administration believed, would help advance global climate talks.\\n\\nBut all of Obama's moves so far\\u00c2\\u00a0have been insufficient to get to that 17 percent cut by 2020. As recent analyses from the Rhodium Group and the Clean Air Task Force\\u00c2\\u00a0have argued, the US also needs to reduce methane emissions dramatically to get there:\\n\\nCarbon-dioxide is the biggest greenhouse gas responsible for global warming. But it's not the only one. There's also\\u00c2\\u00a0methane.\\u00c2\\u00a0The US burns a lot of methane \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 known as \\\"natural gas\\\" \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 for energy. But when methane leaks out of oil and gas wells or pipelines and into the atmosphere, it acts as a potent greenhouse gas. (The White House says it's 25 times as effective at trapping heat as carbon dioxide. Other scientists say 34 times.)\\n\\nIn 2012, the EPA estimated that methane accounted for roughly\\u00c2\\u00a08.7 percent of US greenhouse-gas emissions (though this may be an\\u00c2\\u00a0underestimate). But experts have warned that methane leaks could be poised to grow in the coming years.\\n\\nThanks to the\\u00c2\\u00a0fracking boom, US energy companies have been extracting more and more natural gas from shale formations. On one level, that's good news for climate change: utilities are now burning more natural gas for electricity instead of coal, which means lower carbon-dioxide emissions from power plants.\\n\\nThe problem is that all this new drilling increases the risk of methane leaking into the air \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 and those leaks\\u00c2\\u00a0are undermining the climate benefits of the gas boom.\\n\\nIn theory, it should be doable to plug these methane emissions,\\u00c2\\u00a0which can come from leaky pipelines or faulty drilling operations. Many companies already\\u00c2\\u00a0use infrared cameras to detect leaks and plug them. And they have financial incentives to do so \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 after all, these companies would rather capture that methane and sell it for money than just have it float off into the air.\\n\\nMany oil and gas companies are already taking steps to detect and plug leaks\\n\\nStill, the White House wants to make sure these leaks really get plugged. So, on Wednesday, it\\u00c2\\u00a0announced a goal of cutting methane emissions from oil and gas operations 45 percent below 2012 levels by 2025.\\n\\nThis would be done through a combination of guidelines for voluntary actions by the industry and a hodgepodge of new regulations\\u00c2\\u00a0crafted by the EPA and other agencies. Some rules would focus on methane leaks from new oil and gas wells. Others would focus on pipelines used to transport the natural gas. The Interior Department is updating standards for drilling on public lands.\\n\\nThe White House noted that the oil and gas industry has already managed to cut methane emissions 16 percent since 1990 through voluntary measures. \\\"Nevertheless,\\\" it added, \\\"emissions from the oil and gas sector are projected to rise more than 25 percent by 2025 without additional steps to lower them.\\\"\\n\\nSome environmental groups said the White House's plan didn't go far enough. For example, the EPA is currently only working on rules to reduce emissions at new oil and gas wells \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 and only much later will they work on rules for\\u00c2\\u00a0existing wells, which are by far the biggest source of emissions.\\n\\n\\\"While setting methane standards for the first time is an important step, failing to immediately regulate existing oil and gas equipment nationwide misses 90% of the methane pollution from the industry,\\\" Conrad Schneider of the Clean Air Task Force said in a statement.\\n\\nJayni Hein, policy director at the Institute for Policy Integrity at NYU School of Law, agreed: \\\"EPA's steps announced today would trim the sector's methane releases by about a third. We can and should go farther by regulating existing oil and natural gas sources.\\\"\\n\\nBy contrast, many oil and gas companies don't want new regulations at all \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 they argue that the industry is already curbing methane leaks as is.\\u00c2\\u00a0\\\"Emissions will continue to fall as operators innovate and find new ways to capture and deliver more methane to consumers,\\\" said Jack Gerard, head of the American Petroleum Institute, in a statement. \\\"Existing EPA and state regulations are working. Another layer of burdensome requirements could actually slow down industry progress to reduce methane emissions.\\\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, it's worth noting that there are other sources of methane besides oil and gas. In 2012,\\u00c2\\u00a0according to the EPA, roughly 30 percent of methane in the United States came from natural-gas and petroleum operations (though, again, that may be an undercount).\\n\\nObama is relying on voluntary measures for methane in agriculture\\n\\n-- By contrast,\\u00c2\\u00a036 percent of US.methane emissions came from agriculture. The beef and dairy industry is a major contributor here: when cows belch, they produce methane (known as \\\"enteric fermentation\\\"). Other sources include decomposing cow manure, as well as methane from rice cultivation.\\n\\n-- Another\\u00c2\\u00a018 percent came from landfills. When food and other trash decays in a landfill, the organisms that feed on that trash emit methane into the atmosphere.\\n\\nThe Obama administration\\u00c2\\u00a0has been working on steps to cut methane in these areas, too. Back in March, the EPA announced it would come up with standards to reduce methane from all future landfills. It will then solicit public comments on whether to regulate landfills that have already been built.\\n\\nAs for cow burps, however, the administration is relying on purely voluntary measures for now. In June 2014, the EPA unveiled a \\\"partnership\\\" with the dairy industry to speed up the adoption of methane digesters that turn cow dung into energy. The hope is to reduce methane emissions from the dairy sector 25 percent by 2020.\\n\\nFurther reading: Obama has promised to cut US emissions 17% by 2020.

responsibility for sunday s attack on a texas cartoon contest featuring images of the muslim prophet muhammad the claim was made in an audio message on the group s al bayan radio station based in the syria city of raqqa which isis has proclaimed to be the capital of its self proclaimed caliphate it is the first time isis has taken credit for an attack on u s soil though it was not immediately clear whether the group s claim was an opportunistic co opting of a so called lone wolf attack as its own the message described the shooting suspects as two soldiers of the caliphate and added we tell america that what is coming is more bitter and harder and you will see from the soldiers of the caliphate what harms you the message also said the contest which was being put on by a group known for controversial rhetoric about islam was portraying negative images of the prophet muhammad house homeland security committee chairman michael mccaul r texas told fox news tuesday that the attack was terrorism and at the very least inspired by isis mccaul also said in the days leading up to the attack a joint fbi and homeland security bulletin was circulated and security for the event had been ramped up as a result in garland understanding that it was a target an investigation following the attack revealed a striking connection between at least one of the gunmen and a twitter account based overseas suggesting that isis operatives had knowledge of the attack beforehand and that the same fighters encouraged the shooters a counterterrorism source told fox news one british based jihadi in syria who does not tweet on a regular basis sent out a message within an hour of the attack praising both men another established isis twitter account suggested he had been in contact with one of the gunmen just prior to the attack using messages such as he tried to reach him but just missed him the source said the social media appeared to show encouragement and mentoring the contest had been expected to draw outrage from the muslim community according to mainstream islamic tradition any physical depiction of muhammad even a respectful one is considered blasphemous and drawings similar to those featured at the texas event have sparked violence around the world authorities say the suspects identified as elton simpson and nadir soofi drove up to the building where the contest was being held in the dallas suburb of garland and opened fire an unarmed school district security guard was wounded before a garland police officer returned fire and killed both men soofi had a long standing hatred of police and had studied overseas in islamabad pakistan according to a facebook account that has since been disabled he once owned a pizza and hot wings restaurant in phoenix called cleopatra but sold it years ago as it was struggling the new york times reports public records showed that soofi and simpson were living in the same apartment complex in phoenix but it was not clear if they lived together according to the newspaper homeland security secretary jeh johnson said in a statement monday that law enforcement authorities are investigating the men s motives and all circumstances surrounding the attack court documents show that simpson had first been noticed by the fbi in due to his ties to a a former u s navy sailor who had been arrested in phoenix and was ultimately convicted of terrorism related charges in simpson was arrested one day before he was scheduled to fly to south africa to undertake what he claimed were religious studies at a madrassa recordings played at simpson s trial indicated that he was using his studies as an excuse to travel to somalia to link up with militant fighters there despite the more than hours of recorded conversations including simpson s discussions about fighting nonbelievers for allah whom he referred to as kuffars the government prosecuted him on only one minor charge lying to a federal agent he faced three

responsibility for sunday s attack on a texas cartoon contest featuring images of the muslim prophet muhammad the claim was made in an audio message on the group s al bayan radio station based in the syria city of raqqa which isis has proclaimed to be the capital of its self proclaimed caliphate it is the first time isis has taken credit for an attack on u s soil though it was not immediately clear whether the group s claim was an opportunistic co opting of a so called lone wolf attack as its own the message described the shooting suspects as two soldiers of the caliphate and added we tell america that what is coming is more bitter and harder and you will see from the soldiers of the caliphate what harms you the message also said the contest which was being put on by a group known for controversial rhetoric about islam was portraying negative images of the prophet muhammad house homeland security committee chairman michael mccaul r texas told fox news tuesday that the attack was terrorism and at the very least inspired by isis mccaul also said in the days leading up to the attack a joint fbi and homeland security bulletin was circulated and security for the event had been ramped up as a result in garland understanding that it was a target an investigation following the attack revealed a striking connection between at least one of the gunmen and a twitter account based overseas suggesting that isis operatives had knowledge of the attack beforehand and that the same fighters encouraged the shooters a counterterrorism source told fox news one british based jihadi in syria who does not tweet on a regular basis sent out a message within an hour of the attack praising both men another established isis twitter account suggested he had been in contact with one of the gunmen just prior to the attack using messages such as he tried to reach him but just missed him the source said the social media appeared to show encouragement and mentoring the contest had been expected to draw outrage from the muslim community according to mainstream islamic tradition any physical depiction of muhammad even a respectful one is considered blasphemous and drawings similar to those featured at the texas event have sparked violence around the world authorities say the suspects identified as elton simpson and nadir soofi drove up to the building where the contest was being held in the dallas suburb of garland and opened fire an unarmed school district security guard was wounded before a garland police officer returned fire and killed both men soofi had a long standing hatred of police and had studied overseas in islamabad pakistan according to a facebook account that has since been disabled he once owned a pizza and hot wings restaurant in phoenix called cleopatra but sold it years ago as it was struggling the new york times reports public records showed that soofi and simpson were living in the same apartment complex in phoenix but it was not clear if they lived together according to the newspaper homeland security secretary jeh johnson said in a statement monday that law enforcement authorities are investigating the men s motives and all circumstances surrounding the attack court documents show that simpson had first been noticed by the fbi in due to his ties to a a former u s navy sailor who had been arrested in phoenix and was ultimately convicted of terrorism related charges in simpson was arrested one day before he was scheduled to fly to south africa to undertake what he claimed were religious studies at a madrassa recordings played at simpson s trial indicated that he was using his studies as an excuse to travel to somalia to link up with militant fighters there despite the more than hours of recorded conversations including simpson s discussions about fighting nonbelievers for allah whom he referred to as kuffars the government prosecuted him on only one minor charge lying to a federal agent he faced three

responsibility for sunday s attack on a texas cartoon contest featuring images of the muslim prophet muhammad the claim was made in an audio message on the group s al bayan radio station based in the syria city of raqqa which isis has proclaimed to be the capital of its self proclaimed caliphate it is the first time isis has taken credit for an attack on u s soil though it was not immediately clear whether the group s claim was an opportunistic co opting of a so called lone wolf attack as its own the message described the shooting suspects as two soldiers of the caliphate and added we tell america that what is coming is more bitter and harder and you will see from the soldiers of the caliphate what harms you the message also said the contest which was being put on by a group known for controversial rhetoric about islam was portraying negative images of the prophet muhammad house homeland security committee chairman michael mccaul r texas told fox news tuesday that the attack was terrorism and at the very least inspired by isis mccaul also said in the days leading up to the attack a joint fbi and homeland security bulletin was circulated and security for the event had been ramped up as a result in garland understanding that it was a target an investigation following the attack revealed a striking connection between at least one of the gunmen and a twitter account based overseas suggesting that isis operatives had knowledge of the attack beforehand and that the same fighters encouraged the shooters a counterterrorism source told fox news one british based jihadi in syria who does not tweet on a regular basis sent out a message within an hour of the attack praising both men another established isis twitter account suggested he had been in contact with one of the gunmen just prior to the attack using messages such as he tried to reach him but just missed him the source said the social media appeared to show encouragement and mentoring the contest had been expected to draw outrage from the muslim community according to mainstream islamic tradition any physical depiction of muhammad even a respectful one is considered blasphemous and drawings similar to those featured at the texas event have sparked violence around the world authorities say the suspects identified as elton simpson and nadir soofi drove up to the building where the contest was being held in the dallas suburb of garland and opened fire an unarmed school district security guard was wounded before a garland police officer returned fire and killed both men soofi had a long standing hatred of police and had studied overseas in islamabad pakistan according to a facebook account that has since been disabled he once owned a pizza and hot wings restaurant in phoenix called cleopatra but sold it years ago as it was struggling the new york times reports public records showed that soofi and simpson were living in the same apartment complex in phoenix but it was not clear if they lived together according to the newspaper homeland security secretary jeh johnson said in a statement monday that law enforcement authorities are investigating the men s motives and all circumstances surrounding the attack court documents show that simpson had first been noticed by the fbi in due to his ties to a a former u s navy sailor who had been arrested in phoenix and was ultimately convicted of terrorism related charges in simpson was arrested one day before he was scheduled to fly to south africa to undertake what he claimed were religious studies at a madrassa recordings played at simpson s trial indicated that he was using his studies as an excuse to travel to somalia to link up with militant fighters there despite the more than hours of recorded conversations including simpson s discussions about fighting nonbelievers for allah whom he referred to as kuffars the government prosecuted him on only one minor charge lying to a federal agent he faced three

hillary rodham clinton have go to war with the fbi the word unprecedented have be throw around so often this election that it ought to be retire but it s still unprecedented for the nominee of a major political party to go war with the fbi but that s exactly what hillary and her people have do coma patients just wake up now and watch an hour of cnn from their hospital bed would assume that fbi director jam comey be hillary s opponent in this election the fbi be under attack by everyone from obama to cnn hillary s people have circulate a letter attack comey there be currently more media hit piece lambast him than target trump it wouldn t be too surprise if the clintons or their ally be to start run attack ads against the fbi the fbi s leadership be be warn that the entire leave wing establishment will form a lynch mob if they continue go after hillary and the fbi s credibility be be attack by the media and the democrats to preemptively head off the result of the investigation of the clinton foundation and hillary clinton the covert struggle between fbi agents and obama s doj people have go explosively public the new york time have compare comey to j edgar hoover its bizarre headline jam comey role recall hoover s fbi fairly or not practically admit up front that it s spout nonsense the boston globe have publish a column call for comey s resignation not to be outdo time have an editorial claim that the scandal be really an attack on all women jam carville appear on msnbc to remind everyone that he be still alive and insane he accuse comey of coordinate with house republicans and the kgb and you think the vast right wing conspiracy be a stretch countless media stories charge comey with violate procedure do you know what s a procedural violation email classify information store on your bathroom server senator harry reid have send comey a letter accuse him of violate the hatch act the hatch act be a nice idea that have as much relevance in the age of obama as the tenth amendment but the cable news spectrum quickly fill with media hack glance at the wikipedia article on the hatch act under the table while accuse the fbi director of one of the most awkward conspiracies against hillary ever if jam comey be really out to hurt hillary he pick one hell of a strange way to do it not too long ago democrats be breathe a sigh of relief when he give hillary clinton a pass in a prominent public statement if he really be out to elect trump by keep the email scandal go why do he trash the investigation be he on the payroll of house republicans and the kgb back then and play it coy or be it a sudden development where vladimir putin and paul ryan talk him into take a look at anthony weiner s computer either comey be the most cunning fbi director that ever live or he s just awkwardly try to navigate a political mess that have trap him between a doj leadership whose political futures be tie to hillary s victory and his own bureau whose apolitical agents just want to be allow to do their job the only truly mysterious thing be why hillary and her associate decide to go to war with a respect federal agency most americans like the fbi while hillary clinton enjoy a unfavorable rat and it s an interest question hillary s old strategy be to lie and deny that the fbi even have a criminal investigation underway instead her associate insist that it be a security review the fbi correct her and she shrug it off but the old breezy denial approach have give way to a savage assault on the fbi pretend that nothing be wrong be a bad strategy but it be a better one that pick a fight with the fbi while lunatic clinton associate try to claim that the fbi be really the kgb there be two possible explanations hillary clinton might be arrogant enough to lash out at the fbi now that she believe that victory be near the same kind of hubris that lead her to plan her victory fireworks display could lead her to declare a war on the fbi for irritate her during the final miles of her campaign but the other explanation be that her people panic go to war with the fbi be not the behavior of a smart and focus presidential campaign it s an act of desperation when a presidential candidate decide that her only option be to try and destroy the credibility of the fbi that s not hubris it s fear of what the fbi might be about to reveal about her during the original fbi investigation hillary clinton be confident that she could ride it out and she have good reason for believe that but that hillary clinton be go in her place be a paranoid wreck within a short space of time the positive clinton campaign promise to unite the country have be replace by a desperate and flail operation that have focus all its energy on fight the fbi there s only one reason for such bizarre behavior the clinton campaign have decide that an fbi investigation of the latest batch of email pose a threat to its survival and so it s go all in on fight the fbi it s an unprecedented step bear of fear it s hard to know whether that fear be justify but the existence of that fear already tell us a whole lot clinton loyalists rig the old investigation they know the outcome ahead of time as well as they know the debate question now suddenly they be no longer in control and they be afraid you can smell the fear the fbi have wiretap from the investigation of the clinton foundation it s find new email all the time and clintonworld panic the spinmeisters of clintonworld have claim that the email scandal be just so much smoke without fire all that s here be the appearance of impropriety without any of the substance but this isn t how you react to smoke it s how you respond to a fire the misguide assault on the fbi tell us that hillary clinton and her ally be afraid of a revelation bigger than the fundamental illegality of her email setup the email setup be a preemptive cover up the clinton campaign have panic badly out of the belief right or wrong that whatever crime the illegal setup be mean to cover up be at risk of be expose the clintons have weather countless scandals over the years whatever they be protect this time around be bigger than the usual corruption bribery sexual assault and abuse of power that have follow them around throughout the years this be bigger and more damage than any of the allegations that have already come out and they don t want fbi investigators anywhere near it the campaign against comey be pure intimidation it s also a warn any senior fbi people who value their career be be warn to stay away the democrats be close rank around their nominee against the fbi it s an ugly and unprecedented scene it may also be their last stand hillary clinton have awkwardly wind her way through numerous scandals in just this election cycle but she s never show fear or desperation before now that have change whatever she be afraid of it lie bury in her email with huma abedin and it can bring her down like

but my grandparents be more than years ago they arrive in new york city from iran i grow up mainly in central new jersey an american kid play little league for the raritan red sox and soccer for the raritan rovers in i travel with my family to our ancestral land i be only eight but old enough to understand that the iranians have lose their liberty and freedom i saw the abject despair of a people who in a desperate attempt to bring about change have usher in nationalist tyrants lead by ayatollah khomeini what i witness during that year in iran change the course of my life in at age want to help preserve the blessings of liberty and freedom we enjoy in america i enlist in the u s navy now with the rise of donald trump and his nationalist alt right movement i ve come to feel that the value i seek to protect be in jeopardy in iran theocratic fundmentalists sow division and hatred of outsiders of westerners christians and other religious minorities here in america the right wing seem to have steal passages directly from their playbook as it spread hatred of immigrants particularly muslim ones this form of nationalistic bigotry islamophobia threaten the heart of our nation when i choose to serve in the military i do so to protect what i view as our sacred foundational value of liberty equality and democracy now years later i ve join force with fellow veterans to again fight for those sacred value this time right here at home death to america as a child i sit in my class at the international school one sunny morning and hear in the distance the faint sound of gunfire and rise chant of death to america that day would define the rest of my life it be tehran the capital of iran in i be attend a unique school for bilingual students who have be bear in western nations it have become the last refuge in that city with any tolerance for western teach but that also make it a target for military fundamentalists as the gunfire draw closer i hear boot pound the marble tile outside march into our build and thunder down the corridor toward my classroom as i hear voice chant death to america i remember wonder if i would survive to see my parent again in a flash of green and black uniform those soldier rush into our classroom grab us by our shirt collar and yell at us to get outside we be then pack into the school s courtyard where a soldier point his rifle at our group and command us to look up almost in unison my classmates and i raise our eye and saw the flag of our many nations be tear down and dangle from the balcony then set ablaze and toss still burn into the courtyard as those flag float to the grind in flame the soldier fire their gun in the air shout they order us if we ever want to see our families again to swear allegiance to the grand ayatollah khomeini and trample on the remain of the burn symbols of our home countries i scan the smoke that be fill the courtyard for my friends and classmates and horrify watch them capitulate and begin to chant death to america as they stomp on our sacred symbols i be so angry that young as i be i begin to plead with them to come to their sense no one pay the slightest attention to an eight year old and yet for the first time in my life i felt something like righteous indignation i suspect that bear and raise in america i be already imbue with such a sense of privilege that i just couldn t fathom the immense danger i be in certainly i be act in ways no native iranian would have find reasonable across the smoke fill courtyard i saw a soldier come at me and know he mean to force me to submit i spot an american flag still burn drop to my knees and grab the char piece from underneath a classmate s feet as the soldier close in on me i duck and run still clutch my char piece of flag into a crowd of civilians who have gather to witness the commotion the events of that day would come to define all that i have ever stand for or against camel jockey ayatollah and gandhi my parent and i soon return to the unite state and i enter third grade more than anything i just want to be normal to fit in and be accept by my peer unfortunately my first name nader which i change to nate upon join the navy and my swarthy middle eastern appearance be little help on that score elicit regular jib from my classmates even at that young age they have already master a veritable thesaurus of ethnic defamation include camel jockey sand nigger raghead ayatollah and ironically gandhi which i now take as a compliment my classmates regularly seek to other ize me in those years as if i be a lesser american because of my faith and ethnicity yet i remember that tingle in my chest when i first don my cub scout uniform all because of the american flag patch on its shoulder something felt so good about wear it a feel i still have when i join the military it seem that the flag i try to rescue in tehran be staple to my heart or that s how i felt anyway as i wear my country s uniform when i take my oath of enlistment in the u s navy i give my mom a camera and ask her to take some photos but she be so overwhelm with pride and joy that she cry throughout the ceremony and manage to snap only a few image of the carpet she cry even harder when i be select to serve as the first muslim american member of the u s navy presidential ceremonial honor guard on that day i be proud too and all the taunt of those bully of my childhood seem finally silence be torment because of my ethnicity and religion in those early years have another effect on me it cause me to become unusually sensitive to the nature of other people somehow i grasp that if it weren t for a fear of the unknown there be an inherent goodness and frail humanity lurk in many of the kid who bully and harass me often i discover those same bully could be tremendously kind to their families friends or even strangers i realize then that if despite everything i could lay myself bare and trust them enough to reach out in kindness i might in turn gain their trust and they might then see me too and stop operate from such a place of fear and hate through patience humor and understand i be able to offer myself as the embodiment of my people and somehow defang the otherness of so much that americans find scary to this day i have friends from elementary school middle school high school and the military who tell me that i be the only muslim they have ever know and that have they not meet me their perspective on islam would have be wholly subject to the prevail fear base narrative that have poison this country since september in i become special assistant to the master chief petty officer of the navy and then in i be recruit to serve at the defense intelligence agency in august i transfer to the naval reserve in the wake of i begin to observe how so many of my fellow americans be adopt a fundamentalist us vs them attitude towards muslims and islam i suddenly find myself in an america where the scatter insult i have endure as a child take on an overarch and sinister mean and form where they become something like an ideology and way of life by the time i complete my military service in i have begin to understand that our policies in the middle east similarly disturb seem in pursuit of little more than perpetual warfare that in turn be make possible by the creation of a new enemy islam or rather of a portrait paint by the power that be of islam as a terror religion as a hood villain lurk out there somewhere in the desert wait to destroy us i know that attempt to dispel through the patient approach of my childhood the kind of islamophobia that now have the country by the throat be not go to be enough post attack on muslims in the u s and elsewhere be not merely childish taunt for the first time in my life in a country grip by fear i believe i be witness a shift en masse toward an american fundamentalism and ultra nationalism that reflect a wanton lack of reason not to mention fact as a boy in iran i have witness the dark destination down which such a path could take a country now it seem to me in america s quest to escape the very demons we have sow by our own misadventures in the middle east and forsake the hallmarks of our found we risk become everything we seek to defeat the boy in the schoolyard grow up on february three young american students yusor abu salha razan abu salha and deah shaddy barakat be execute at an apartment complex in chapel hill north carolina the killer be a gun crazy white man fill with hate and describe by his own daughter as a monster those assassinations strike a special chord of sorrow and loss in me my mom and i cry and pray together for those students and their families the incident in chapel hill also awake in me some version of the righteous indignation i have felt so many years earlier in that smoke fill courtyard in iran i would be damn if i stand by while kid in my country be murder simply because of their faith it violate every word of the oath i have take when i join the military and desecrate every value i hold in my heart as a sacred tenet of our nation white nationalists and bigots have by then throw down the gauntlet for so much of this use islamophobia to trigger target assassinations in the unite state this be terrorism pure and simple inspire by hate speakers here at home at that moment i reach out to fellow veterans who i think might be will to help and it s true what they say about soul mat be irrevocably draw to each other when i contact veterans for peace an organization dedicate to expose the cost of war and militarism i find the leadership well aware of the inherent dangers of islamophobia and of the need to confront this new enemy so executive director michael mcphearson form a committee of vet from around the country to decide how those of us who have don uniform to defend this land could best battle the phenomenon and i of course join it from that committee emerge veterans challenge islamophobia vci it now have organizers in arizona georgia new jersey and texas and that s just a begin totally nonpartisan vci focus on politicians of any party who engage in hate speech we ve meet with leaders of american muslim communities sit with them through ramadan and attend their iftar dinners to break our fast together in the wake of the orlando shoot we at vci also mobilize to fight back against attempt to pit the muslim community against the lgbtq community our group be bear of the belief that as american military veterans we have a responsibility to call out bigotry hatred and the perpetuation of endless warfare we want the american muslim community to know that they have ally and that those ally be indeed veterans as well we stand with them and for them and for those of us who be muslim among them nationalism and xenophobia have no place in american life and i for my part don t think donald trump or anyone like him should be able to peddle islamophobia in an attempt to undermine our national unity without islamophobia there no longer exist a clash of civilizations without islamophobia whatever the problems in the world may be there be no longer an us vs them and it s possible to begin reimagining a world of something other than perpetual war as of now this remain the struggle of my life for despite my intense love for america some of my countrymen increasingly see american muslims as the other the enemy my mom teach me as a boy that the only thing that matter be what be in my heart now with her in mind and as a representative of vci when i meet fellow americans i always remember my childhood experience with my bully peer and i still lay myself bare as i do then i give trust to gain trust but always know that these days this isn t just a matter of niceties it s a question of life or death it s part of a battle for the soul of our nation in many ways i still consider myself that boy in the school courtyard in tehran

terrible mistake on libya when she be secretary of state but at the time trump also support u s action that lead to the removal of moammar gadhafi from power trump cherry pick clinton s word when he claim clinton say vet be be treat essentially just fine clinton have say the problems in the department of veterans affairs be not as widespread as some republicans claim but she go on to acknowledge problems include the issue of wait time for doctor the forum sponsor by nbc news and the iraq and afghanistan veterans of america be hold sept at the intrepid sea air space museum in new york city today show host matt lauer and members of the military and veterans in the audience question the candidates separately trump say he be totally against the war in iraq while clinton claim that he support the iraq war before and after it start the facts don t support either candidate s strong assertions our review of trump s statements before and after the iraq war start find no evidence that trump oppose the war before it start in fact he express mild support for invade iraq when ask about it on the howard stern radio show on sept about six months before the war start stern ask trump if he support a war with iraq and trump respond yeah i guess so in the nbc commander in chief forum trump cite an esquire article that appear in august to show his opposition to the war but that article appear months after the war start as for clinton who as a senator vote in october to authorize the war in iraq the democratic nominee claim that trump support it before it happen he support it as it be happen and he be on record as support it after it happen but just as there be no evidence that trump oppose the iraq war before it start the clinton campaign offer no evidence that trump support the war after it happen the clinton campaign cite trump s interview on march with neil cavuto of fox business just two days after the war start cavuto ask trump about the impact of the war on the stock market trump say the war look like a tremendous success from a military standpoint and he predict the market will go up like a rocket after the war but cavuto do not ask trump whether the u s should have go to war with iraq or whether he support the war and trump doesn t offer an opinion as early as july trump express concern on hardball with chris matthews about money be spend in iraq rather than in the u s two months later trump tell msnbc s joe scarborough i guess maybe if i have to do it i would have fight terrorism but not necessarily iraq clinton invite her audience to read trump s comment on the iraq war they can read our timeline donald trump and the iraq war trump say president obama set a certain date for withdraw troop from iraq but that date be actually set by president george w bush nbc s matt lauer ask trump about his tendency to respond when push for detail on his military proposals that he s not go to give detail because he want to be unpredictable trump respond absolutely and go on to criticize obama for reveal the withdrawal date as we say then republicans and democrats disagree on whether obama or bush be to blame for withdraw all combat troop from iraq at the end of but that date be set when bush sign the status of force agreement on dec it say all the unite state force shall withdraw from all iraqi territory no later than december in the nbc forum trump also call the withdrawal of troop a terrible decision as we ve explain before condoleezza rice bush s secretary of state later write that bush want an agreement for a residual force to remain but iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki object once obama take office in january he have three years to renegotiate the deal which his administration try to do to leave a residual american troop force but maliki still didn t agree negotiations break down in october over the issue of whether u s troop would be shield from criminal prosecution by iraqi authorities whether obama do enough be a matter of opinion his then defense secretary leon panetta later write that the president didn t press hard enough for a deal but some experts say iraq be more closely align at the time with iran and there wasn t a deal to be make with maliki so both presidents have a role in the withdrawal of troop but trump wrongly say that obama be the one who set a certain date for withdrawal and let u s enemies know about it when that date be set before obama be swear in it s worth note that trump say in a march interview on cnn that the troop should be withdraw quickly from iraq trump say that obama s visit to china saudi arabia and cuba be the first time in the history the storied history of air force one when high officials of a host country do not appear to greet the president that s not true other presidents have encounter similar low key greetings on foreign trip aboard the presidential aircraft trump refer to the fact that cuba s president raul castro do not greet obama at the airport on his historic visit to cuba in march that saudi arabia s king salman do not meet air force one at the start of obama s trip to riyadh in april and he refer to china s handle of the president s arrival in hangzhou last saturday for a group of meet whether or not those arrivals constitute snub of a u s president as trump claim be a matter of debate but trump be wrong on the facts when he claim it have not happen before it have in for example ronald reagan land in beijing and be receive by china s foreign minister rather than the president whom he meet only later similarly on a trip to west germany reagan be meet by the foreign minister and not chancellor helmut kohl these and other examples be dig up by our friend glenn kessler the washington post s fact checker who research a trump claim in april that cuba s and saudi arabia s handle of obama s visit be without precedent kessler say of trump once again he s wrong wrong wrong kessler also note that during richard nixon s historic visit to china he be greet at the airport by the country s number two man premier zhou enlai his boss chairman mao didn t even agree to meet with nixon until after he have arrive at a guest house clinton say that her plan to overhaul the veterans health administration would not include privatization which she say trump support but trump refute that statement when it be his turn to discuss his plan to help veterans i would not do that trump say refer to clinton s claim that he support privatization trump s campaign publish the goals of donald j trump s veterans plan on its website last october it doesn t call for the va to be completely privatize one of the biggest change that plan would make to the current va health care system be allow veterans to get care at any non va medical center that accept medicare under a trump administration all veterans eligible for va health care can bring their veteran s id card to any doctor or care facility that accept medicare to get the care they need immediately the plan state the power to choose will stop the wait time backlog and force the va to improve and compete if the department want to keep receive veterans healthcare dollars the plan say trump s proposal would seemingly go further than the non va medical care program which allow eligible veterans to access care outside of the va under certain circumstances such as when va medical center can not provide service the program require pre approval for veterans to receive care at a non va facility in non emergency situations trump s proposal would also go further than the bipartisan veterans choice act of that president obama sign into law create a temporary program separate from the non va medical care program that allow eligible veterans to receive health care at a non va facility if they would have to wait more than days for an appointment at a va medical center or if they live more than miles from the nearest va hospital trump stick to the idea of allow veterans to choose between public and private hospitals when he release his most recent ten point plan to reform the va in july point of the plan say mr trump will ensure every veteran have the choice to seek care at the va or at a private service provider of their own choice under a trump administration no veteran will die wait for service trump reinforce that part of his plan during the nbc news forum as well to be clear trump support give veterans a choice between va hospitals and private ones that s not the same thing as support the complete privatization of the system that provide care to veterans trump criticize clinton for make a terrible mistake on libya when she be secretary of state but at the time trump also support u s action that lead to the removal of moammar gadhafi from power trump make his claim in response to a question pose by lauer on whether trump will be prepare on day one if elect president to tackle complex national security issue this isn t the first time trump have ignore his past support for the u s intervention in libya during the th gop debate trump say he have never discuss that subject when sen ted cruz call him out on support u s action in the country but as we write trump say in that the u s should go into libya on a humanitarian basis and knock gadhafi out very quickly very surgically very effectively and save the live trump make that comment in a video post to his youtube channel in february even though trump now say clinton s support for intervention in libya be a terrible mistake it doesn t change the fact that five years ago he support gadhafi s removal trump twist clinton s word when he claim clinton say vet be be treat essentially just fine clinton say the problems in the department of veterans affairs be not as widespread as some republican supporters of privatization of the va claim but she go on to acknowledge problems in the va system include the issue of wait time for doctor and what she would do to address them trump highlight the issue of wait time to see a doctor as one of the big problems in the va and then suggest clinton doesn t think the va have problems lauer interrupt note that clinton go on after that and lay out a litany of problems within the va trump insist his version be accurate add i m tell you she say she be satisfy with what be go on in the veterans administration that s not accurate the comment in question from clinton come during an interview with msnbc s rachel maddow on oct maddow ask about talk among some republicans of abolish the va and privatize it the reason they be able to propose something that radical be because the problems at the va seem so intractable maddow say maddow ask if clinton have any new ideas for try to fix the va here be clinton s response with the part trump be refer to in bold clinton accuse republicans of underfunding the va because they want it to fail so they can privatize it clinton add but we have to be more creative about try to fix the problems that be the legitimate concern so that we can try to stymie the republican assault indeed the clinton campaign website state that clinton want to fundamentally reform veterans health care to ensure access to timely and high quality care the campaign say clinton be outrage by the recent scandals at the va and as president she will demand accountability and performance from va leadership the site specifically mention clinton s dissatisfaction that m any veterans have to wait an unacceptably long time to see a doctor or to process disability claim and appeal and promise she will b uild a st century department of veterans affairs to deliver world class care trump cherry pick the part of clinton s response that say problems in the va have not be as widespread as it have be make out to be to make the blanket claim that clinton be satisfy with what be go on in the veterans administration and that vet be be treat essentially just fine but trump be leave out the part of clinton s answer that acknowledge problems in the va include the wait time issue trump highlight as one of his biggest concern\n","iran reportedly make new push for uranium concessions in nuclear talk iranian negotiators reportedly have make a last ditch push for more concessions from the u s and five other world power as talk on the fate of iran s nuclear program come down to the final days before a crucial deadline the new york time report late sunday that tehran have back away from a tentative promise to ship a large portion of its uranium stockpile to russia where it could not be use as part of any future weapons program western officials insist to the paper that the uranium do not have to be send overseas but could be dispose of in other ways the new twist in the talk come just two days before the deadline for both side to agree on a framework for a permanent deal the final deadline for a permanent deal would not arrive until the end of june however if iran insist on keep its uranium in the country it would undermine a key argument make in favor of the deal by the obama administration the time report that if the uranium have go to russia it would have be convert into fuel rods which be difficult to use in nuclear weapons it be not clear what would happen to the uranium if it remain in iran the associate press report sunday that iran s position have shift from from demand that it be allow to keep nearly centrifuge enrich uranium to agree to keep western officials involve in the talk tell the associate press that tehran may be ready to accept an even lower number the unite state and its ally want a deal that extend the time iran would need to make a nuclear weapon from the present two months to three months to at least a year however the time report sunday that a paper publish by olli heinonen former head of inspections for the u n s nuclear watchdog estimate that iran could still develop a nuclear weapon in seven or eight months with around centrifuge tehran say it want to enrich uranium only for energy science industry and medicine but many countries fear iran could use the technology to make weapons grade uranium officials tell the associate press that another main dispute involve the length of an agreement iran they say want a total lift of all cap on its activities after years while the u s and the five other nations at the talk russia china britain france and germany insist on progressive removal after a decade a senior u s official characterize the issue as lack of agreement on what happen in years to the official speak on condition of anonymity in line with state department rule on brief about the close door talk limit on iran s research and development of centrifuge also be unresolved the western officials say tehran have create a prototype centrifuge that it say enrich uranium time faster than its present mainstay model the u s and its partner want to constrain research that would increase greatly the speed of make enough weapons grade uranium for a bomb once limit on iran s program be lift one official say russia oppose the u s position that any u n penalties lift in the course of a deal should be reimpose quickly if tehran renege on any commitments both western officials say iran be resist attempt to make inspections and other ways of verification as intrusive as possible there be tentative agreement on turn a nearly finish reactor into a model that give off less plutonium waste than originally envisage plutonium like enrich uranium be a path to nuclear weapons iran and the u s be discuss let iran run centrifuge at an underground bunker that have be use to enrich uranium the machine would produce isotopes for peaceful applications the officials say with the tuesday deadline approach and problems remain u s secretary of state john kerry cancel plan sunday to return to the unite state for an event honor the late u s sen edward kennedy french foreign minister laurent fabius and frank walter steinmeier his german counterpart scratch plan trip to kazakhstan kerry have be in discussions with iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif since thursday the associate press contribute to this
